# Hello

Hello all! It has been a while since I last blog. Now, I'm moving to a new platform where (hopefully) minimal efforts are required, but opportunities to extend the site usage and functionality are available as well. I saw there are a few coding projects that can be done, and I plan to implement them in the near future.


# Update

For the past few months, I have been working on several projects, which kept me occupied for some time. Using busy as a reason that I don't keep my blog up to date seem like an easy excuse; I think more of it comes from distraction from daily lives, where I'll need to divert my attention in various places. Having said that, I wondered how much percentage of useful attention and effort are spent at.

# Plans

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is unlike WordPress. I found this platform to be quite interesting to work with, especially when it is programmable to a certain extent.

I will update again in the near future, hopefully with some interesting stuff.

With that, I leave here, a piece from **Ryuichi Sakamoto**:
