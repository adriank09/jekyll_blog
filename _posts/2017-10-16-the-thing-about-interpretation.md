One great thing I love about artistic works is that one is free to interpret what the work is about. The meaning behind the work, the significance, the impacts, and what sort of thoughts were carried by its author/artist while creating the work.

Take a Chinese poem, **A Flower in the Haze (花非花)** by Tang Dynasty's __Bai Ju Yi (白居易)__ for example.

> In bloom, she's not a flower;
> Hazy, she's not a haze;
> She comes at midnight hour;
> She goes with starry rays;
> She comes like vernal dreams that cannot stay;
> She goes like morning clouds that melt away;

> 花非花, 雾非雾；
> 夜半来, 天名去。
> 来如春梦几多时？
> 去似朝云无觅处。

[Hujiang Chinese](https://cn.hujiang.com/new/p474662/) describes the poem as follow:

> There are a series of metaphors employed in this poem. Though we don’t know exactly about what the poem is writing about, we have the impression that it is something beautiful, transient, desirable but intangible. The whole poem describes the poet's regrets and memory about the people and things that have gone and never return in his life.

The poet never really describes what are the things that he regrets, making it perhaps, an unsolvable mystery to its readers. We, as readers, can relate to him as time goes by.

That's a poem. What about a musical piece?

Depending on its tone, theme, and others, I often interpret it by how I think, and how I related it to something.

See, an artistic work is an open work. People can openly interpret it, be it the same or different than its artist/author, and the general public. As I read through some comments and thoughts regarding a work on the Internet, I often found people who had the same thought as mine, and also people who disagrees with mine. I generally accept them open-minded (with the exceptions of extreme negative ones, of course).

Take a musical piece, with two versions, titled **asience** by **Ryuichi Sakamoto**:

"Fast piano" version

And, here's someone who plays the piano piece:

How would you interpret the varities of the same musical piece?
